;On the trip, lunch must be provided for all students. For each student, track 
;their name, their grade (from 1 to 12), and whether or not they have allergies.

;PROBLEM B:
;
;To plan for the field trip, if students are in grade 6 or below, the teacher 
;is responsible for keeping track of their allergies. If a student has allergies, 
;and is in a qualifying grade, their name should be added to a special list. 
;Design a function to produce true if a student name should be added to this list.

;; Student -> Boolean
;; produce true if the given student is at or below grade 6 and has allergies
